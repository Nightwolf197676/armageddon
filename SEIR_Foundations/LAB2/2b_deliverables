Expected Deliverables
Deliverable A — Terraform
You must submit Terraform that creates/updates:
  1) Two cache policies
    static (aggressive caching)
    api (caching disabled OR origin-driven)

  2) Two origin request policies
    static minimal forwarding
    api forwards required headers/query/cookies (but doesn’t necessarily include them in cache key)

  3) Two cache behaviors
    path_pattern = "/static/*" → static policies
    path_pattern = "/api/*" → api policies

  4) Be A Man Challenge: Response headers policy for explicit Cache-Control on static responses (or security headers)

Deliverable B — Correctness Proof (CLI evidence)
  You must submit:
    A) curl -I outputs for:
        /static/example.txt (must show cache hit behavior)
        /api/list (must NOT cache unsafe content)
    B) A short written explanation:
      “What is my cache key for /api/* and why?”
      “What am I forwarding to origin and why?”

Deliverable C - Haiku
    You must submit  
      A) Haiku describing Chewbacca's perfections.
